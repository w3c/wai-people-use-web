## Introduction
{:#introduction.no-display}

*How do people who cannot move their arms use your website? What about
people who cannot see well or at all? Or people who have difficulty
hearing or understanding, or have other disabilities?*

This resource introduces how people with disabilities, including people
with age-related impairments, use the Web. It describes tools and
approaches that people with different kinds of disabilities use to
browse the Web and the barriers they encounter due to poor design. It

creating accessible websites, web applications, browsers, and other web
tools.
