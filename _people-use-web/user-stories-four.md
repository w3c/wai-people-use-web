## About Lee

> I often miss items on sale because it is hard for me to spot the red labels used to indicate them. Sometimes completing the check out process is tricky because if I overlook a mandatory field, I get an error or warning message in red and it’s hard for me to see the message".

Lee was born with deuteranopia and protanopia (often called "color blindness"). He has difficulty distinguishing among items that are red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear to him as kind of murky brown.

Lee discovered that shopping for clothes online is actually an advantage over going to physical stores. In addition to just showing pictures of items in the various colors offered, his favorite sites include color labels making coordinating what goes together much easier. Sometimes when checking out though, the required fields and error messages are notated with a red outline and Lee has to pay special attention to identify them. He noticed lately, however, that a lot of sites are getting better about using a secondary notation like an asterisk for required fields and bold text or an arrow pointing to errors. This really helps a lot.

Lee plays in various fantasy football leagues with his friends and workmates. Sometimes there can be problems with the way these sites use color to differentiate between teams, player positions and whether or not players are selected for his team. As a result, he tends to prefer certain Fantasy Football apps over others which means he has to try and convince friends to play using the same app.

## Assistive technologies and adaptive strategies used

* [Customized fonts and colors (Presentation)](/people-use-web/tools-techniques-presentation/#style)

## Barrier examples

Using color only barrier
: **Problem:** When I select a color choice there is nothing to help me differentiate between the colors.
: **Works well:** Color choices are shown with a descriptive name. The good sites have a link to a slightly longer description of the color.

Color only used for errors barrier
: **Problem:** When filling out a form online, required fields and errors are marked with a red outline. 
: **Works well:** In addition to color, an asterisk or words are used to identify required fields and errors.

Color only in games barrier
: **Problem:** When I play an online game, enemies are marked with a red circle and friends marked with a green circle and I can't tell the difference.
: **Works well:** Enemies are also marked with a symbol/use a red triangle so I can easily identify them.

Chart labels barrier
: **Problem:** When I am reading news articles with data charts, I can't understand the charts as the columns aren't labelled clearly.
: **Works well:** The columns are directly labelled or use a texture as well as color.
