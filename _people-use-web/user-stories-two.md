## About Ian

> I find it hard to focus on busy pages. For example, lots of animations and videos, particarly ones that start without me doing anything.

Ian is autistic. His autism was identified at an early age because of delays in speech development. Ian received a lot of early childhood support, which helped him develop language and social skills. However, he still has some problems with language, especially when experiencing anxiety.

Ian works part-time as a data entry clerk. Working with a computer is easy for Ian, although updates to the data entry application can cause him problems if there are significant changes to the interface. This can cause feelings of axiety for Ian if he doesn't know the change is coming and given time to adapt. It can also be difficult for Ian if someone asks for some work that means he has to use parts of the system that he is not as familiar with. Most of the systems have a consistent layout and navigation but some are completely different and this can confuse Ian a bit.  

Ian finds interacting with colleagues via email easy. He has worked with his team to help them appreciate how using plain language and avoiding too many metaphors can help him. Many have said they also prefer less corporate jargon as well. 

Ian has his own living space in his parent's home including his own kitchen. He has been learning how to cook using online videos. He finds straightforward, practical, step-by-step videos really helpful. However, if the video is full of metaphors, vague language, or implied content, it can be more difficult to understand. Some of the cooking sites he uses have a lot of adverts on them with banners and video which can be distracting. This is particularly bad if there is audio as well, especially if Ian can't control it easily.

## Barrier examples

Non-literal text barrier
: **Problem:** "I have difficulty understanding metaphors, acronyms, abbreviations, and words that aren't used in their literal sense."
: **Works well:** "Websites that spell everything out and don't use metaphors are easier for me to understand."

Plain language barrier
: **Problem:** "Sites that use "fancy" language or long sentences to describe a simple concept are hard to understand."
: **Works well:** "I'm better at understanding the content when the authors just use plain language and simple sentences."

Consistent layout and navigation barrier
: **Problem:** "I get confused when I go to a different page on a website and the layout and navigation aren't the same."
: **Works well:** "When there is a consistent "look" to the pages on a site, I can learn where things are."

Heading structure barrier
: **Problem:** "Long pages that are not broken up into sections are hard to read and understand."
: **Works well:** "Descriptive headings that are styled like an outline help me to find what I want and better understand the content."

Moving or blinking content barrier
: **Problem:** "Moving or blinking content is distracting and I can't remember what I wanted to do.
: **Works well:** It's best when sites don't use moving or blinking content but if they do, let me turn it off."
