| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Ade, reporter with limited use of his arms. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Ade, reporter with limited use of his arms." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:07 | [Alan:] Hello! I'm Ade. I have a spinal cord injury from an accident X years ago. I'm quadriplegic, which means I have limited movement in my arms as well as my legs. | We see Alan speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Alan sitting in a wheelchair and gesturing to show he his hands and fingers as he speaks about them. [Viewers might notice his hands and fingers don't move as he gestures with his arms.] |
| 4 | 0:50 - 1:19 | The techonology I use is really important to me. I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts, espeicially for programs that I often use. For example, scrolling a page is much easier with the arrow keys on the keyboard than by clicking on that small button in the scroll bars. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Alan switching back from using the joystick to the keyboard to type in something brief, then back again to the joystick to continue navigating (e.g. clicking "next" button after typing in something brief on a form). We see Alan using the down-arrow key to scroll down a web page (e.g. the newly loaded page after clicking "next). This back-and-forth switching seems strenuous. |
| 5 | 1:19 - 1:47 | Unfortunately, many websites and apps don’t work well with my keyboard. The Tab-key should take me through each page object by object in a logical order. Often what has focus is not clear it jumps around completely out of order. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Alan now using the Tab-key to move between objects on the web page (e.g. a form in the newly loaded page, the one he was scrolling on). The focus indicator first moves in a logical order (e.g. from "street address" to "post code"), then it jumps somewhere completely unexpected (e.g. "use same as shipping address" at the top of the form, which disables the text fields that Alan just filled in when he check it). |
| 6 | 1:47 - 2:10 | Sometimes websites and apps work better on my tablet than on the computer because I can click the buttons and links on the touch screen with my knuckles. I can also type the same way using the on-screen keyboard. Sometimes that doesn't work well because some websites and apps don’t work in landscape orientation, which is how I setup my tablet so that the buttons are big enough for me to click. | [New scene.] We see Alan using a tablet computer in landscape orientation (e.g. mounted to his wheelchair or on a stand). We see it first works well, then it doesn't anymore (e.g. Alan clicks the icon of his email program; reads a new email from a friend; follows a link in that email; the website opens in portrait orientation -- sideways for Alan). |
| 7 | 2:10 - 2:45 | While I can use a keyboard and joystick, I can’t use them for long periods because it's tiring. So, I recently started using speech control software as well. It allows me to dictate text instead of typing, and to say certain commands instead of clicking. It's really hard to learn a new way of working after so many years but I've been patient with it and I'm slowly getting used to it. The most difficult thing is buttons without labels -- it is not clear what words would activate them. | [New scene.] We see Alan speaking (we only see his mouth move but don't hear what he is saying), and see the words appearing on the screen. We see the words being corrected on the screen (e.g. "white flour" being corrected to "white flowers" in the search field of an online grocery shop). We zoom in on a small icon button beside the search field with no visual label (eg. an icon of binoculars or another icon for "search"). [We don't really see what happens next but from the narration and the way that nothing happens visually, some viewers might assume there is something wrong with the button.] |
| 8 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Alan:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Alan speaking his line directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Ian, data scientist with autism. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Ian, data scientist with autism." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Ian:] Hello! I'm Ian. I'm autistic. I work for a software company three bus stops from my home. | We see Ian speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Ian with no immediately apparent aspects of his disability [possibly some subtle aspects depending on the actual protagonist]. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I'm a data scientist. I enjoy my work very much. Others find this work difficult because it's quite technical. But for me, it's really easy. | [New scene.] We see Ian on the way to work (e.g. in a bus, at a bus station, or walking down a street). We then see Ian at his workplace. We see Ian making his way to his workspace (Note: small talk and small greets can be unlikely or uncomfortable but real tactical connections, such as bringing a meaningful gift to someone because you know it will make a difference for them, are more characteristic). We see Ian settling in and starting to work. |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Except when something changes and I don't have enough time to figure out what changed. Like, when I was trying to get to an online meeting and found that the buttons on the app changed. It was very stressful because I was worried about being late to the meeting. Apps that ask for permission before updating allow me to find a suitable time and adjust to the changes. | [New scene.] We see Ian at his workspace, starting a teleconference app to log into a meeting. We see a banner or pop-up appear "New version of Online Meeting App available, do you want to install now?", and we see Ian selecting "No" or "Later" and the banner/pop-up disappears. Ian looks relieved at not having to install a new update just before the meeting. |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Sometimes I press the wrong thing and everything just changes and I don't know how to go back. It makes me feel like I just can't cope. I am trying to work, but I just can't and I start to panic, and then I can't even talk anymore. It's very important to me when I can roll back and undo changes that I didn't intend or expect to happen. | [New scene.] We see Ian participating at the online meeting from the previous scene. We see Ian mistakenly click on one of the meeting participants, and that window expands to full screen. We see Ian surprised by this and anxiously looking for something to revert this change. We see Ian notice the usual "X" close button on the top right of the window, and looks relieved as he presses that button and everything is back to normal. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | It's also really frustrating when I have to stop work because of an error message that doesn't tell me what the error is. Error messages that just say "input error" are so useless. Often it's something really simple, like I didn't use the right format for the date. Why doesn't it say that? | [New scene.] We see Ian at his workspace on a different day (e.g. workspace is slightly modified, Ian's clothes are different, ...). We see Ian entering data in a form. We turn to the screen and see a rediculously obnoxious error message like "Incomplete entry" or such. We see Ian getting upset about not being helped by this error message. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I love to cook when I'm not working. My friends love to eat what I cook because I find the best recipes! Some cooking websites and apps are easy to use — my favorite recipe sites list the exact ingredients and have step-by-step instructions. It's easy to find the recipes using the tags and to follow them. | [New scene.] We see Ian in a kitchen with cooking cloak following cooking instructions on a nearby digital assistant with a screen. We zoom onto the screen and see cooking instructions that are laid out very clearly (e.g. uses grouping, whitespace, headings, lists, ...). Ian looks happy. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Unfortunately, I can't use some recipe sites even though they have recipes I really want to try. Especially the ones where all sorts of videos start playing and pop-up windows appear without me pressing anything. I didn't ask for this! These are overwhelming and aren't the recipe. All I want is the recipe! | [New scene.] We see Ian in a different setting looking for recipes on a mobile phone. We see Ian click on a link and get to a site with lots of ads and pop-ups. He tries to close one ad but the site still seems so overwhelming that he decides to go back to the earlier site. |
| 9 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Ian:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Ian speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between certain colors (color blindness). | [Front plate.] box with the text "Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between certain colors (color blindness)." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | [Lexie:] Hello! I'm Lexie. I was born with deuteranopia and protanopia, which people often call "color blindness". | We see Lexie speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Lexie with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:33 | I have difficulty distinguishing between red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear to me as kind of murky brown. In a store, I often can't tell the color of two shoes or two shirts beside each other. I love online shopping because it's often easier for me when they use the names of the colors in addition to showing the colors. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a casual environment (e.g. at home or at a cafe etc.) using a computer. We see the computer screen with a colorful website using red, green, orange, and brown as they are mentioned. We realize that Lexie is shoping clothes, selecting colors of a product (e.g. shirt, shoe, etc.) with the names of the colors changing as he selects them  [we intentionally will not turn all colors to brown or such]. |
| 3 | 0:33 - 1:03 | Unfortunately, not all online shops have an accessible checkout experience for me. Often the sign-up or checkout form says "fields in red are required". Ugh! Most times I can't tell which fields are required when they use color only. Good shops either have the word "required" or that little star beside the fields, or even better put the word "optional" beside the ones I can skip. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Lexie continuing to the check-out area; he's a new customer to this website and is asked to register. The registration form has many fields (e.g. street name, number, post code, state, region, country, ...), some of which are in red. We see the note "Fields in red are manadatory", and we see Lexie focusing on the screen more closely. |
| 4 | 1:03 - 1:31 | Not relying on color alone is important for other websites and apps too! For example, my favorite fantasy football app has a symbol for each team on the jersey of the players, in addition to color. This helps me spot the players on my team more quickly, not just by reading the names under each player. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a casual enviroment (same or different setting, depending on filming logistics), who is now playing a fantasy football game. We see the players of the two teams have differently colored jerseys with different symbols as well. Lexie is very engaged in the game (e.g. biting her tongue, moving around with the game controller, ...). |
| 5 | 1:31 - 2:03 | Color issues also happen at work. For example, when my colleagues highlight words in a document without using the commenting function. The commenting function outlines the marked text in addition to highlighting it. Another example is when charts don't have symbols as well as the colors for lines and bars -- I can't identify them from color alone. My team is usually careful about this but sometimes the suppliers we work with aren't. | [New scene.] We see Lexie in a work enviroment (e.g. home office or office) reading a document with comments indicated (e.g. in the document margin). The corresponding text areas are outlined and highlighted as Lexie selects the comments. We then see Lexie studying a bar chart using different colors for the different bars, in addition to a legend that identifies each bar by label. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Lexie:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Lexie speaking her line directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Sophie, basketball fan with Down syndrome. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Sophie, Basketball fan with Down syndrome." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Sophie:] Hello! I am Sophie. I have Down Syndrome. I love basketball! I played on my school team, and now I work at the stadium. | We see Sophie speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Sophie. [Viewers might notice aspects of her disability.] |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | At work, we use an app for our team. It has a calendar with all our practices and games. My job is to record the scores and stuff like that. I can also use it to chat with the coach and with the players, and we use it to exchange photos and jokes too [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Sophie with a tablet at a basketball court (e.g. with others playing the background or just on her own, depending on filming logistics). We then transition to Sophie using the app (e.g. recording scores and statistices, get a chat message etc.). |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Sometimes, I take longer to read things but this app is really easy to use. The event or name of the player is at the top, so I know where I am in the app. The calendar is also very clear. It shows the name of the month or the number of the week at the top too. Other apps we tried are too confusing -- I could never tell where I am and how to get back. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Sophie using the app but now focus more on the app itself rather than on Sophie and what he is doing. We see Sophie looking at an event, player, and calender as the narration mentions them. [The name of the event, player, month, etc. is clear and placed prominently at the top of the page/view; the app looks neat and tidy, and Sophie looks enjoyed using it.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | The biggest problem is buying tickets for games. I try to use this app for buying but sometimes I have to use other apps to get tickets. Some of these apps are too hard. When I click on something it goes somerewhere else or opens another page. Or, it doesn't have that blue box at the top and I don't know where I am or how to get back. Sometimes, if I take too long, I have to start all over again. It's a real pain. I wish buying tickets could be easier. | [New scene.] We see Sophie using a ticketing app. It looks more crammed and he is looking more focused while using the app. We see Sophie find a game and select "buy ticket", which takes him to a very differently looking form asking for billing and shipping details for the credit card purchase. Sophie is looking more frustrated. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | My dream is to become a senior assistant. I know I can do it. Soemtimes it is hard for me to write long things but I use the spell-checker every time. It helps me when coaches use words I already know. Otherwise, it takes me even longer to find the words in the dictionary. One day I'll make it! | [New scene.] We see Sophie sorting books in a library. We then transition to see Sophie sitting in front of a computer at work. We see Sophie reading more slowly and with some difficulty, and we see that he has an online dictionary open beside the text he is reading to lookup difficult words. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Sophie:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Sophie speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Martine, older adult student who is Deaf. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Dhruv, older adult student who is deaf." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:15 | [Dhruv] Hello! I'm Dhruv. I'm Deaf. I can hear some sounds but not enough to understand speech. Sign language is my native language -- I think and dream in signs. | We see Dhruv signing directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Dhruv and realize that he is communicating through a sign language interpreter who is speaking what he signs [the voice we hear]. |
| 2 | 0:15 - 0:35 | I recently enrolled in an online degree. For my classes, I schedule interpreters who interpret the lectures and conversations, and voice for me. I need video conferencing apps with functionality to "pin" videos of the interpreters so that I can always see them. | [New scene.] We see Dhruv in a video conference meeting with multiple people online. We see two sign language interpreters join the meeting. The windows for the interpreters are labeled accordingly, and we see Dhruv take particular attention to these two windows. We see Dhruv use a "pin to screen" function for the interpreters and for the current speaker. We see him signing back to the interpreter to speak up in the meeting. We don't really see the exact signs or hear the interpreter while the scene transitions, we just see that he is actively participating in the meeting. |
| 3 | 0:35 - 1:15 | Some lectures have realtime captioning typed by human captioners. This is more accurate than automatic captions, which often don’t recognize specialized terms in the lectures. For our assigned videos, I rely on good captions. These are edited so that each sentence appearing on the screen is not too long and is synchronized with the audio. I also often find myself needing to adjust the text size and colors of the captions, to be able to read them better. Some apps also allow me to move the captions to the top or bottom of the video, so that they are not in the way. | [New scene.] We see Dhruv watching an online lecture with captions. [We see that the captions indicate who is speaking but don't see enough to actually read the entire text.] We see Dhruv switching from the live lecture to a pre-recorded video (e.g. browse through a collection of videos and select one of them). We see Dhruv switching on captions for that video and adjusting the text size. We also see Dhruv moving the captions above the video where he can see them better. |
| 4 | 1:15 - 1:40 | In some situations, I find myself lip reading. For example, when I'm on unplanned calls without interpreters or other people who can sign. I learned lip reading over the years because of such situations but it's not always reliable for me. I need to see the person's mouth, have them speak clearly, and seeing their gestures also helps. Yet it's exhausting and not really something I can keep doing for too long. | [New scene.] We see Dhruv in a video conference meeting with multiple people online, similar to that in scene #2. This time, there are no sign language interpreters present. She is focusing on the mouth of the person speaking. She is trying to understand what they are saying but the person is sometimes turning away from the camera (e.g. to point at a board or otherwise gesture). Dhruv is looking increasingly tired. |
| 5 | 1:40 - 1:55 | I also use the chat function. Some chat tools support realtime text rather than line-by-line text messages only. This is much more interactive, and I can engage with my friends in text conversations as others do by voice. | [Continuation from previous scene.] We see Dhruv using the chat function to exchange with other people on the call. Dhruv is engaged in the discussion and smiling as he types. |
| 6 | 1:55 - 2:20 | Of course, the classes also come with a lot of reading. I'm fine with that, except when the writing is unnecessarily complex and without structure like lists and headings. People don’t realize that for me reading text involves extra effort, because sign language is my native language. So, like for everyone else, clear and simple writing makes text easier to understand. | [New scene.] We see Dhruv having difficulty understanding a page with with long and justified paragraphs, little spacing, few headings that are hardly distinguishable, and without any structure. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Dhruv:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Dhruv signing his line directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Marta, a marketing assistant who is deaf and blind. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Marta, a marketing assistant who is deaf and blind." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:08 | [Marta:] Hi! I'm Marta, a marketing assistant at my School for the Deaf. I'm Deaf-blind. I was born deaf and have progressive vision loss, which means I can still see things if they're large and up-close but I see less and less each year. | We see Marta signing directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Marta and realize that she is communicating through a sign language interpreter who is speaking what she signs [the voice we hear]. |
| 2 | 0:08 - 0:25 | As a Deaf child, I learned sign language early on. But now I can't see when someone signs back to me. So, if I'm with someone who signs, like my friend, I adapted to using a form of tactile signing where my friend places my hands in the sign positions, to understand what they are signing. But not everybody knows how to sign. | [New scene.] We see Marta using tactile sign [excact form of tactile sign depends on the actual protagonist] with an interpreter. We see Marta is in an environment where she needs to understand something being said; for example, in a classroom. |
| 3 | 0:25 - 1:05 | This is why technology is so important to me -- it allows me to communicate with more people. At home, I have a computer that can enlarge my documents upto 20 times. I have a big screen but can still only see a very small portion of the screen, and an even smaller portion of the documents because it's like looking through a magnification lens. I can find my way around documents with headings and sections that look different. For example, this briefing sheet uses a color for the headings that is different from the main content, which makes it easier for me to recognize them. | [New scene.] We see Marta sitting (at home) at a computer with a very large monitor. We see her engaged in interaction and leaning in very closely to the monitor to read. We then shift over to see the screen with the school website she is speaking about. We scan over the navigation and main content area, and over a series of easy-to-distinguish headings with different levels as she mentions them. |
| 4 | 1:05 - 1:34 | Oh, and I'm learning to use braille too. Braille are those dots that you read with your fingers, and I have this really cool device called a "refreshable braille display" -- it's a small device that I can take with me everywhere, unlike my computer. It has apps for email, web, and chat, and some have a special keyboard for typing in braille. I read the braille characters in a row on the device, which I'm slowly getting used to. It's always difficult to learn to use something new at first but I'm getting better at reading and typing braille. | [New scene.] We see Marta in a different environment (e.g. in another part of her home or at school) using a refreshable braille display. We see Marta scanning her fingertips over the braille letters; she looks focused and possibly revisiting letters and words with her fingers before refreshing the display. |
| 5 | 1:34 - 2:17 | But not all websites and apps work well with magnification or on my braille display. Like when I need to look up the bus schedule to meet up with my friends -- that table doesn't work well when I enlarge it on my phone. And forget about trying to read it in braille. I can't tell what row or column I'm in and it just jumps all over the place! It makes me nervous because I can't as easily ask for help from people around me while I'm out, so I've been learning how to speak up and ask companies for more accessible websites and apps to help me stay independent. | [New scene.] We see Marta at a bus stop busily engaged with her refreshable braille display. She looks a little anxiuos and maybe somewhat annoyed too. We shift over to the overhead display on the bus stop to see it has a notification reading "10 minutes delay" (this scene depends on filming logistics). |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Marta:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Marta signing her line directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. We see more and more protagonists from the other videos appear on the screen [to illustrate many people] as the narrator speaks their line. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Stefan, student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Stefan, student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Stefan:] Hello! I'm Stefan. I have dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- ADHD. | We see Stefan speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Stefan with no visible disability. |
| 2 | 0:00 - 0:00 | I have difficulty recognizing or sounding out written words, even though I use those same words in conversation all the time. It affects my spelling and my reading comprehension. It often takes me a long time to figure out the individual words I'm reading, and then it's hard for me to remember how the words in a sentence fit together in a meaningful way. My dyslexia also causes uneven memory for me. | [New scene.] We see Stefan (maybe at home or in a classroom, depending on filming logistics) doing homework, for example doing specialized exercises, such as dividing a printed word into syllables (by using a pencil to "scoop" or make a semicircle under each syllable) or moving around square letter tiles on a magnetic board, with the consonant tiles all in one color and the vowel tiles all in another color (to help kids with dyslexia focus on the vowel sounds). [Stefan is a smart student who has difficulty reading, and should appear that way.] |
| 3 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Digital books and documents are often much better for me. On the computer, on a tablet, or – my favorite – on my new e-reader. I can change the font type, text size, and line spacing, which makes it easier for me to read. I also use the read-aloud function because I read better when I can see and hear the text at the same time. It also highlights the words being read aloud and has a reading ruler, so that I can follow along more easily. | [New scene.] We see Stefan using an e-reader to read a digital book. We see his changing the text properties (e.g. font type, text size, and line spacing) and the text adapts accordingly. We see Stefan follow along the text being read aloud and being highlighted on the screen at the same time (maybe Stefan has earphones/headphone, depending on filming logistics. [We do not hear the actual reading but the camera might focus on the earphones, headphones, or loud speaker to indicate the audio.] |
| 4 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Sometimes, though, digital books and documents don't work well. Sometimes they are just scanned images. These also can't be read aloud and I can't change the text size and font. Some don't have bookmarks, which I use to jump to the parts I want to focus on. Or, there are long chunks of text without any headings, so I have difficulty focusing on the content. It is so much easier when text has more spacing and graphics to make them easier to follow. | [New scene.] We see Stefan reading a document (e.g. school material put together by a teacher) on a computer. We see him try to change the text properties similarly to how it changed in the previous scene, only that the text remains unchanged. We also see long chunks of text without any headings to separate the content. We see Stefan has difficulty navigating and using this document. We see Stefan close this document and open a different one. This document looks much more structured with table of contents, generous whitespace, distinguishable headings, page numbering, indication of current page, illustrations/graphics, and such. |
| 5 | 0:00 - 0:00 | Another problem is when I have to do online research. I type in words, but sometimes I do it wrong, or use a different word that sounds the same, like "brake" when I mean "break". Sometimes I land on websites with all these ads and things popping up and moving around the screen. With ADHD, I get distracted by these ads and videos, and sometimes I click on them and forget what I was meant to be doing. I use several pop-up blockers but they don't always work. | [New scene.] We see Stefan using the same computer as in the previous scene, only one using a web browser instead of reading a document. We see Stefan start to type some search phrase (e.g. "effects of climate change"), and we see word prediction/completion happening in the search field. We see Stefan select one of the suggestions without needing to type out the entire phrase. We see Stefan selecting one of the search results, and just as he gets comfortable and starts reading, a pop-up/dialog appears with an annoying ad (e.g. "free 30-day subscription"). Stefan looks frustrated as he clicks away this ad. |
| 6 | 0:00 - 0:00 | When I find an article I want to read, I try to remember to switch to reading mode in my browser. This usually removes all the stuff around the page and lets me focus on the text. But some websites don't work well and the ads still appear, or the text is too difficult for me to read. I love it when websites work well with my settings and extensions. Like, the extension for spelling and grammar, which helps me when I'm typing things like email. That's very important for me. | [New scene.] We see Stefan in the same setting as in the previous scene, only now writing article on the same topic (e.g. "effects of climate change"). We see the words get underlined with red as Stefan types them, and we see Stefan going back to correct them. We see Preet turning on a word-prediction extension that helps his select from words as he starts typing the first letters. |
| 7 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Stefan:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Stefan speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |

| 0 | 0:00 - 0:00 | [Narrator:] How people with disabilities use the web; Elias, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss. | [Front plate.] box with the text "Elias, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss." |
| 1 | 0:00 - 0:10 | [Elias:] Hello! I'm Elias. I'm a retired architect. Life moves slower now that I'm retired, and I think my body does too [laughs]! | We see Eliase speaking directly to us viewers [documentary style into the camera]. We briefly see a total of Elias, who is an older adult.  [Viewers might his stronger glasses and hand tremors.] |
| 2 | 0:10 - 0:34 | I see less and hear less than in my younger days. Also, my hands shake a little. My children live far away, so we see each other online instead. We also write to each other and send pictures. It's so much easier and quicker than going to the post office every time [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Elias (at home) in front of a computer with a webcam engaged in an online meeting with his grandchildren (possibly also his daughter, depending on filming logistics). |
| 3 | 0:34 - 0:59 | My trouble is all this small text! Why do they write so small? I know how to make the text size bigger but it doesn't work with all websites. Sometimes everything seems to break down -- the text overlaps or goes somewhere else or disappears completely. Or, I have to scroll sideways to read -- I don't have the time and energy for that [chuckles]. | [New scene.] We see Elias using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time reading a newspaper online. The text looks very small, and Elias uses browser setting or keyboard shortcut to increase the text size. The website starts breaking (overlapping and disappearing text, and horizontal scroll bars appear). |
| 4 | 0:59 - 1:23 | It's the same with apps. I made the text bigger on my mobile phone. I can't see without doing that on such a small screen. Most apps work well but not the banking app. The text on that app is still small, and I need to use it to log into my bank account. I already called them several times about this but nothing happens. | [New scene.] We see Elias using a mobile phone with noticeably larger text and icons on the screen. We see Elias launching a banking app that has small text. We see Elias squinting and holding the phone more closely to read the text on the app. |
| 5 | 1:23 - 1:43 | It's not only reading, though. When the text is small, all the buttons and links are also small. Sometimes tiny. Especially on forms where you have to click and select all these things -- it's hard with my hands, they don't behave like they used to. | [New scene.] We see Elias back again on the computer from scenes 2 and 3. He is now subscribing to a newsletter and needs to click small checkboxes and radio buttons (they do not have labels, so that the text of these controls doesn't serve as click area). |
| 6 | 1:43 - 2:28 | Our grocery store now has an online shop, which is fantastic because I don't have to carry all the shopping any more. The text is big and it has big links and buttons. It just seems clearer and easier to find things -- everything is where it should be on every page. Usually, I have trouble remembering things, like the telephone number, address, and credit card details. This store remembers from before, so I only need to select the right address in the text field rather than needing to type it each time. I wish all websites could be that easy. | [New scene.] We see Elias using the same computer as in the previous scene, only this time he is shopping in an online store. It has generous click areas (e.g. the entire image and label for products) and big "next" and "back" buttons during the purchase process. We see Elias selecting his address and credit card number from previous entries stored in the browser, as we hear the narration describe this. |
| 7 | 2:28 - 2:35 | [Elias:] You can help make technology accessible to me. [Narrator:] Accessibility: It's about people. | [New scene.] We see Elias speaking directly to us, as in the first scene [documentary style into the camera, in the same style and continuing the first scene]. |
