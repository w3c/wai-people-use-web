The following user stories represent the experiences of some people with disabilities. They do not address all disabilities or all impacts faced by people with disabilities. These and other disabilities may be present from birth or may develop as a results of an accident, illness, or aging.

<mark><em><strong>Draft reviewers:</strong> The placeholder images below will be replaced with photos of the users.</em></mark>

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Ade, reporter with limited use of his arms](/people-use-web/user-stories-one)<br> Ade was involved in an accident which caused a spinal cord injury. This left him with limited use of his arms and no movement or sensation in his legs. He has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years. Ade uses a keyboard with larger keys to help him more easily hit the correct key and a joystick instead of a mouse.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Ian, data entry clerk with autism](/people-use-web/user-stories-two)<br> Ian is autistic. His autism was diagnosed at an early age because of delays in speech development, sometimes called non-speaking autism. Ian received a lot of early childhood support, which helped him develop language and social skills. However, he still has some problems with language, especially when experiencing anxiety.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Ilya, senior accountant who is blind](/people-use-web/user-stories-three)<br> Ilya is blind. She is the chief accountant at an insurance company that uses web-based documents and forms over a corporate intranet. Like many other blind computer users, Ilya does not read Braille.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Lexie, online shopper who cannot distinguish between certain colors (color blindness)](/people-use-web/user-stories-four)<br> Lexie was born with deuteranopia and protanopia (often called "color blindness"). She has difficulty distinguishing among items that are red, green, orange, and brown, all of which appear kind of a murky brown.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Sophie, basketball fan with Down syndrome](/people-use-web/user-stories-five)<br> Sophie was born with Down syndrome and has mild to moderate cognitive delay. Due to her distinct facial appearance and difficulties with speech, many people underestimate Sophie's intelligence and capabilities.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Dhruv, older adult student who is deaf](/people-use-web/user-stories-six)<br> Dhruv has been deaf since birth. He is a mature student, taking online courses. While he can hear some sounds, he does not hear enough to understand speech.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Marta, teenager who is deaf and blind](/people-use-web/user-stories-seven)<br> Marta is a teenager who was born deaf and with typical vision. She recently became legally blind too. Marta has some residual vision and can see small portions of a computer screen when it is significantly enlarged. She communicates using sign language and a portable electronic Braille device.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Stefan, student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia](/people-use-web/user-stories-eight)<br> Stefan is a student who has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ADHD makes it hard for him to pay attention and focus on his schoolwork, something he really needs to do to keep up with his classmates. Reading is especially difficult.

* {:.left} [{% include image.html src="profile.png" alt="" %} Elias, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss](/people-use-web/user-stories-nine)<br> Elias has low vision, hand tremor and short term memory loss. Elias had a long and successful career as an architect. He delayed retirement until he was in his 70's because as the senior architect in his firm, he was often sought after to mentor the new hires and guest lecture at local universities. Elias always wore glasses but over time, the demands of the close-up work necessary to render architectural drawings strained his eyes to the point that he could only work a couple of hours at a time. He finally had to stop work when he developed a mild hand tremor and found it too difficult to maintain the precision required for his work.
