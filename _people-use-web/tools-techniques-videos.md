        Many people with cognitive and learning disabilities rely on clear layout and design to find information on websites and apps. This includes different ways of navigating the content, such as using hierarchical menus as well as search functionality; with visual orientation cues, such as using background colors to indicate different parts of the content; using unique headings; and placing relevant information in prominent areas. It’s also important to use a consistent and predictable design.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        While many of these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, these situations often affect people with disabilities to a greater extent. For example, people with low vision who use screen magnification also rely on visual orientation cues to orient themselves and find information on websites and apps.
      </td>

        Woman with low vision uses magnification software on her desktop to view the same pet supply website, only seeing a portion of the screen at one time.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        And consistency and predictability helps everyone. For example, people who are blind use screen readers to scan the content structures, such as headings, links, and navigational menus to get an overview and orient themselves. Websites and apps with clear and consistent headings, labels, and structures make the content more predictable and easier to navigate.

    <tr>
      <td>
        In addition, people who are blind rely on mechanisms to skip over blocks of content, such as headings, navigation bars, or menus, repeated within websites and apps. They also rely on websites and apps to provide clear instructions and help users identify and correct mistakes, such as incorrect dates, numbers, and other input.

      <td>
        In addition, people with physical disabilities rely on consistent labels on websites and apps, which allow browsers to optionally remember previous entries. This speeds up typing because people can select previous entries, for example names and addresses.

        However, even when using these tools, people might have difficulty selecting small targets, such as small links, buttons, and controls. Websites and apps with large clickable areas around checkboxes, radio buttons, and other controls, are easier to use for people with limited mobility and reduced dexterity.

        Websites and apps also need to provide support for people who use the keyboard only. This includes providing ways to skip over repeated content, such as headers and navigation bars, as well as not breaking the default functionality in browsers and operating systems.

      <td>
        Additionally, not everyone using only the keyboard can see the screen; for example, people who are blind. So, in addition to ensuring keyboard support, websites and apps also need to provide clear instructions, labels for form controls, error messages, and status notifications, so that people know what is happening on the screen.
      </td>

        Websites and apps need to help people find and correct mistakes in their input; for example, by showing a summary of the entered data before submitting it.

        They also need to provide sufficient time to complete tasks, or avoid timing limitations altogether. Many people with disabilities require more time to navigate and orient themselves in the content, and to click and type. In particular, people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

        Finally, websites and apps also need to consider people who do not use keyboard or pointing devices at all, and use speech input instead. For example, websites and apps need to be programmed and designed so that the name of a button in the software code matches the name displayed to the user. "Click send email."

        Text on a W3C-WAI website is increased using the browser zoom feature, triggering responsive design. As the text size gets bigger, the navigation menus collapse into a single menu button and the text adjusts so all text fits in the screen width like what would be seen on a mobile device.

        Other people with low vision increase everything on the screen, not only text. They might use screen magnification software as a digital magnifying glass. Some might also change the text and background colors to better read the text, and use text-to-speech to hear the text while they are reading. This means that websites and apps need to be programmed and designed to allow people to change the colors rather than forcing them to appear in a certain way.

        Presentation is not only visual. People with auditory disabilities, for example, might need to increase the volume of online meetings and multimedia like videos, podcasts, and music, without increasing the volume of other system sounds, like notification alerts. Adjusting the bass, treble, and balance of the sound can make the audio easier to hear, so operating systems and media players need to provide these settings. Also, these settings work better with high-quality audio that does not have background noise.

        Presentation adjustments can also make content easier to focus on, particularly for people with different types of cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes "reading modes" that hide less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and front matter; pop-up and animation blockers that help avoid distraction and interruption; and digital reading rules that help readers focus on one line at a time.

        Some reading assistants, for example, those that some people with dyslexia might use, adjust how the text is presented to make it easier to read. This includes changing the font type, text size, colors, and the spacing between letters, sentences, and paragraphs. Some people read better with serif-type fonts and others with sans-serif fonts. Adjusting these properties are individual from one person to another, which is why flexible design is so important.
